# sample config for new 'overlay pack' which would be partial replacement of starterpack..

## Notes:
# preview = # This is a preview image that will be shown in the overlay "store" in the app. - should we have more than one..
###### Should it be a .GIF instead? Video preview??
###### - Recommend 720x480
#########################################
# pathToReplace = # This is the path found in obsconfig.json that we will be replacing to match the users local directory instead.
###### - This is the default path that is being in everything curretly as was redone on my machine.
###### - As users create their own overlays, they would replace this path with their own.


### So instead of the spbuilder creating the config.ini it would create the config.yaml with similar info but as below...
### Sp builder would also cease to exist and we can make a new one called overlay builder??
### this can package it as bggoverlay i reckon...

### so by default we would only have .bgg and .bggoverlay as installable assets   - .bggstarter would be removed at this point to simplify it for users.
### at this point would prefer idea of switching file extensions to someting else than .bgg ???
